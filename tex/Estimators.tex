\section{Implementation}
We orgnize our data and process in six classes. Each class is designed to store the information about Stock, Floren Zmirou
AssetBubble, AssetBubbleDetection, Approximation, and Run.
\subsection{Stock Class}
\paragraph{Methods of Stock Class}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb! IsNumber()!: Input for this function is rowValue. This function determine if rows of stock data is a numerical string or not.
  \item \verb! GetGoogleData()!: Input for this function are Ticker,days and period. This function obtains data for any stock from Google
  finance.
  \begin{algorithm}
  \caption{GetGoogleData ()}
  \bigskip
  \textbf{Inputs}: Ticker, days, period\\
  \textbf{Steps}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \If {the length of the Ticker is less than equal to 3} 
  \State{exchange it with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)}.
  \Else 
  \State {exchange it with Natinal Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)}
  \EndIf\\
  We initialize current time in integer.\\
  We will open Google Finance link.\\
  We initialize dataList to read each line from opened link.\\
  We initialize tickerData to be the list of array of dataList.\\
  We will put stockPrices in list.\\
  We initialize  minuteData.\\
  \For {minuteData in tickerData}
  \State We initialize datum and put split minuteData in commas in datum.
  \State We will append datum row one in float and store it in stockPrice list.\\
  \Return {stockPrices}
  
  
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
 
\end{enumerate}
