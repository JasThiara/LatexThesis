%The Mathematics's Department Timetabling Problem (MDTP) at CSUN is currently solved manually by one faculty member using heuristic methods.  This is a daunting task that takes several weeks every semester.  Depending on the size of the problem, however, timetabling problems can often be solved with evolutionary algorithms.
%
%In this work we explore three of these algorithms: a purely {\it Genetic algorithm}, {\it HereBoy}, and {\it Simulated Annealing}, and we combine them to develop a hybrid algorithm to solve the MDTP more efficiently.   The proposed algorithm combines the genetic algorithm with HereBoy and amounts to a Simulating Annealing algorithm that we apply to help solve the MDTP.
%
%The proposed algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language, and we present it along with several sample schedules that it created.  These sample schedules are feasible. Our algorithm would be a valuable tool for creating the Math Department's semester schedule more efficiently.

Financial Market is very attracting topic in finance and mathematics world. 
Recently we have heard a lot about Gold Prices inflations. 
It is the the hot topic in today's finance market. 
So how will be combine mathematics with today's asset changes like gold? How can we determine the tale of asset's volatility for future?  
These are the questions which we will consider in this thesis. 
We will study non parametric estimator Floren Zmirou in local real time on compact domain with stochastic differential equation which has unknown drift and diffusion coeificents. 
Once we will have volatility from floren zmirou then we will able to use RKHS to estimates function which will extrapolate the tale of function.
}
%Therefore, we explored three evolutionary algorithms that helped us to solve MDTP which are Genetic algorithm, HereBoy algorithm and Simulated Annealing algorithm. By using the hybrid Simulated Annealing algorithm that contained information about Genetic algorithm and HereBoy algorithm, we were able to apply this algorithm to MDTP. 

%We implemented the hybrid Simulated Annealing algorithm by using python programming language. We created few sample schedules and were able to achieve optimal schedules. We can conclude that evolutionary algorithms are much faster than human way of creating a schedule.}
