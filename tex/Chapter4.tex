\chapter{Numerical Solution, Conclusion and Future Work}
Since we have done lot of good work, now it is the time to check the implementation.
We will provide examples which will give better understanding for our problem.
\section{Numberical Solutions using implementation}
Example 1
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ticker: Google
  \item  D : 
  \item  T : 60 seconds
  \item 
\end{itemize}
