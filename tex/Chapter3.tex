\section{Implementation}
We used sage python to solve this problem. We orgnize our data and process in six classes. Each class is designed to store the information about Stock, Floren Zmirou
AssetBubble, AssetBubbleDetection, Approximation, and Run. First we will work with Stock Class.
First We will start with time and stock prices for some stock symbol. First question which will come in mind that How to download and use historic stock prices?
So to answer that question, we initialize Stock Class which will explain step by step process how to download, open, read and save historical stock prices.

\subsection{Stock Class}
\paragraph{Methods of Stock Class}
We obtain stock data by two types of methods. First, we will get it through Google Finance and second, we will get it from CSV file which we download and saved from yahoo finance.
There are four functions IsNumber,GetGoogleData, GetStockPrice,and init in Stock Class.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \verb! IsNumber()!: Input for this function is rowValue. This function determine if rows of stock data is a numerical string or not.
  \item \verb! GetGoogleData()!: Input for this function are Ticker,days and period. This function obtains data for any stock from Google
  finance.
  \begin{algorithm}
  \caption{GetGoogleData ()}
  \bigskip
  \textbf{Inputs}: Ticker, days, period\\
  \textbf{Steps}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \If {the length of the Ticker is less than equal to 3} 
  \State{exchange it with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)}.
  \Else 
  \State {exchange it with Natinal Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)}
  \EndIf\\
  We initialize current time in integer.\\
  We will open Google Finance link.\\
  We initialize dataList to read each line from opened link.\\
  We initialize tickerData to be the list of array of dataList.\\
  We will put stockPrices in list.\\
  We initialize  minuteData.\\
  \For {minuteData in tickerData}
  \State We initialize datum and put split minuteData in commas in datum.
  \State We will append datum row one in float and store it in stockPrice list.\\
  \Return {stockPrices}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
  \item \verb! GetStockPrices()!: Input for this function is csv filename. This function obtains stock prices which are stored
  in csv file by filename. It will read the yahoo API based minute to minute data.
  \begin{algorithm}
  \caption{GetStockPrices ()}
  \bigskip
  \textbf{Inputs}: filename\\
  \textbf{Steps}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \item We saved stock Prices downloaded from yahoo in csv filename.
  \item We initialize cr which will open and read the csv filename.
  \item We skip the header.
  \item Define c1 to be the empty list.
  \For {row in cr}
  \If {the second row is numberical string}
  \State {we add second row to c1.}\\
  \Return{c1}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
  \item \verb! __init__()!: Input for this function is keyward Usage.This function will analyzie wheather csv filename is used or Ticker parameter 
  for Google finance.
  \begin{algorithm}
  \caption{--init--()}
  \bigskip
  \textbf{Inputs}: Keyword Usage \\
  \textbf{Steps}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \If {filename is in keyward Usage}
  \State We  will obtain Stock Prices from GetStockPrices in list of filename
  \Elif{Ticker is used in keyward Usage}
  \State{We will obtain Stock Prices from GetGoogleData in a list of Ticker}
  \Else{We will give exception of bad parameters}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
\subsection{Floren Zmirou Class}
\paragraph{Process to solve Floren Zmirou}
Now we have Stock Prices from Stock class. We will obtain list of sigma values from list of Stock Prices.We will explain this class in following algorithms:\\\\
T = 60*n where T is the minute to minute time period [0,T].\\
Now we will derive hn, x-step\_size, and x values which will be used in Floren Zmirou Estimator.
  \item \verb! (Derive_hn)!: Input for this function is Stock Prices which we obtained from Stock class. 
  This function will derive hn which will be used in Floren Zmirou Estimator.
  \begin{algorithm}

  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \item We obtained hn from Derive hn function.
  \item Double hn = 2 **hn
  \item Difference = max S-min S
  \item x\_hn = Difference * Double hn

  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \item We will use x\_hn from function x step size.
  \item halfh\_n = x\_hn /2.0
  \item We will define x to be equal to empty list.
  \item We will append x with min S + halfh\_n

  \end{algorithm}
 We have $\sigma^2(x)$ for Stock Prices. Now we want to see how many stock prices are in each grid point. 
 If there are less than 0 or 1 percent of stock prices in grid then we will exclude that grid point from
 our calculation process.
 \item \verb! (DoGridAnalysis)!:Input for this function are T,S,x,n,hn.
 Output for this function give us the list of usable grid points and for each usable grid point, the list of Stock prices.

  \textbf{Steps}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \item We initialize x to be useableGridPoints.
  \item Create a empty dictionary and call it d.
  \item We initialize stockPriceCount Si to be the length of Stock Prices.
  \For{grid Points in x}
  \State{create a dictionary where the keys are the grid points and the value is a list for each grid point}
  \For{stockPrice in S}
  \If{|grid Points - stockPriceCount|$\leq$ hn}
  \State{Add x value to corresponding Si}
  \For{grid Points in x}
  \If{if the list of data points corresponding to x has greater than Y percent of total grid points}
  \State{add it to the list of usable grid points}
  \Return

  \item 2) for each usable grid point, the list of stockprices}
  \end{algorithmic}
  \end{algorithm}
\end{enumerate}
