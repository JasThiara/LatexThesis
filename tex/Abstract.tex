Financial Market is very attracting topic in finance and mathematics world. 
Recently we have heard lot about Gold Prices inflations. 
It is the the hot topic in today's finance market. 
So how will be combine mathematics with today's asset changes? How can we determine the tale of asset's volatility for future?  
These are the questions which we will consider in this thesis. 
We will study non parametric estimator Floren Zmirou in local real time on compact domain with stochastic differential equation which has unknown drift and diffusion coeificents. 
Once we will have volatility from floren zmirou then we will able to use RKHS to estimates function which will extrapolate the tale of function.
